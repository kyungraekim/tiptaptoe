# Testing Comment System - Simplified Approach

## Overview
The comment system now uses a **single, simplified approach**:
- **CommentsKit**: Handles all comment functionality including visual highlighting, storage, and operations
- **No dual systems**: Removed the complex TransactionCommentManager integration

This approach prioritizes reliability and simplicity over complex undo/redo functionality.

## Testing Steps

### 1. Open the Application
Navigate to http://localhost:1420/ in your browser after running `npm run dev`.

### 2. Run Automated Tests
Open the browser console and run:
```javascript
testTransactionComments()
```

This will test the TransactionCommentManager integration and undo/redo functionality.

### 3. Manual UI Tests

#### Test Comment Creation with Undo/Redo:
1. **Create a comment:**
   - Select some text in the editor
   - Right-click and select "Add Comment" or use the comment button
   - Add a comment and submit

2. **Verify comment appears:**
   - Check that the comment appears in the comments panel on the right
   - The comment should be visible and editable

3. **Test undo/redo with comments:**
   - Type some text in the editor
   - Create a comment on that text
   - Delete the text (this should remove the comment from the panel)
   - Press Ctrl+Z (Undo) - **the text AND comment should reappear**
   - Press Ctrl+Y (Redo) - **the text should be deleted and comment should disappear**

#### Test Comment Operations:
1. **Update comments:** Edit a comment and verify changes are saved
2. **Delete comments:** Delete a comment and test undo/redo
3. **Resolve comments:** Mark a comment as resolved and test undo/redo

### 4. Verify in Console
Check the browser console for:
- `TransactionCommentManager exposed globally`
- Comment creation/update/delete logs with "transaction support"
- No errors related to comment operations

### 5. Expected Behavior (Simplified System)
- **Text highlighting**: Should appear immediately when creating comments
- **Multiple comments**: Should be able to create multiple comments without removing previous ones
- **Comment operations**: Update, delete, and resolve should work reliably
- **Panel sync**: Comments panel should stay synchronized with CommentsKit
- **No undo/redo support**: Comments will be lost if text is deleted and undone (known limitation)
- **Console logs**: Should see "Creating comment using CommentsKit only" and "Comment created successfully" messages

## Debugging
If issues occur, check the global objects in console:
```javascript
// Check if systems are available
console.log('TransactionManager:', window.transactionCommentManager);
console.log('CommentSynchronizer:', window.commentSynchronizer);

// Check current comments
if (window.transactionCommentManager) {
  console.log('Current comments:', window.transactionCommentManager.getAllCommentsFromHistory());
}
```
